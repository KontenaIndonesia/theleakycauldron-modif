Gatsby JS brought something that everyone was waiting for, a React JS based static site generator, and that too a powerful one. True to their boast that it's really hard to make sloppy website with Gatsby, making it amazing for marketing websites.

When I was writing a website for my company, i found my self wanting a Gatsby starter with following requirements:

* It should be powered by _Netlify_ CMS.
* It should be SEO friendly.
* It should at least have a home page and blog page.
* It shouldn't allow proper styling using some CSS framework like_ Bootstrap_ or _Bulma_.

While all these features are available in various starters none of them were a complete package. So, I decided I'll make one myself.
